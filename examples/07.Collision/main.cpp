/** Example 007 Collision

In this tutorial, I will show how to detect collisions with the Irrlicht Engine.
I will describe 3 methods: Automatic collision detection for moving through 3d
worlds with stair climbing and sliding, manual triangle picking, and manual
scene node picking.

To start, we take the program from tutorial 2, which loads and displays a quake
3 level. We will use the level to walk in it and to pick triangles from it. In
addition we'll place 3 animated models into it for scene node picking. The
following code starts up the engine and loads a quake 3 level. I will not
explain it, because it should already be known from tutorial 2.

	So far so good, we've loaded the quake 3 level like in tutorial 2. Now,
	here comes something different: We create a triangle selector. A
	triangle selector is a class which can fetch the triangles from scene
	nodes for doing different things with them, for example collision
	detection. There are different triangle selectors, and all can be
	created with the ISceneManager. In this example, we create an
	OctTreeTriangleSelector, which optimizes the triangle output a little
	bit by reducing it like an octree. This is very useful for huge meshes
	like quake 3 levels. After we created the triangle selector, we attach
	it to the q3node. This is not necessary, but in this way, we do not
	need to care for the selector, for example dropping it after we do not
	need it anymore.
	*/

				q3levelmesh->getMesh(0), q3node, 128);
		q3node->setTriangleSelector(selector);
	}


	/*
	We add a first person shooter camera to the scene for being able to
	move in the quake 3 level like in tutorial 2. But this, time, we add a
	special animator to the camera: A Collision Response animator. This
	animator modifies the scene node to which it is attached to in order to
	prevent it moving through walls, and to add gravity to it. The
	only thing we have to tell the animator is how the world looks like,
	how big the scene node is, how much gravity to apply and so on. After the 
	collision response animator is attached to the camera, we do not have to do
	anything more for collision detection, anything is done automatically,
	all other collision detection code below is for picking. And please
	note another cool feature: The collision response animator can be
	attached also to all other scene nodes, not only to cameras. And it can
	be mixed with other scene node animators. In this way, collision
	detection and response in the Irrlicht engine is really, really easy.

	Now we'll take a closer look on the parameters of
	createCollisionResponseAnimator(). The first parameter is the
	TriangleSelector, which specifies how the world, against collision
	detection is done looks like. The second parameter is the scene node,
	which is the object, which is affected by collision detection, in our
	case it is the camera. The third defines how big the object is, it is
	the radius of an ellipsoid. Try it out and change the radius to smaller
	values, the camera will be able to move closer to walls after this. The
	next parameter is the direction and speed of gravity.  We'll set it to 
	(0, -10, 0), which approximates to realistic gravity, assuming that our
	units are metres. You could set it to (0,0,0) to disable gravity. And the 
	last value is just a translation: Without this, the ellipsoid with which 
	collision detection is done would be around the camera, and the camera would 
	be in the middle of the ellipsoid. But as human beings, we are used to have our
	eyes on top of the body, with which we collide with our world, not in
	the middle of it. So we place the scene node 50 units over the center
	of the ellipsoid with this parameter. And that's it, collision
	detection works now.
	*/

	// Set a jump speed of 3 units per second, which gives a fairly realistic jump
	// when used with the gravity of (0, -10, 0) in the collision response animator.
	scene::ICameraSceneNode* camera =
		smgr->addCameraSceneNodeFPS(0, 100.0f, 300.0f, -1, 0, 0, true, 3.f);

	Because collision detection is no big deal in irrlicht, I'll describe how to
	do two different types of picking in the next section. But before this,
	I'll prepare the scene a little. I need three animated characters which we
